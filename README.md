easymedia
=========

One 'div' and your media is in.

		Originally created by Alejandro Perez Ordoyo AKA Patchiyama.

		Created to help people who love to have thin html or the one that doesn't like complications.
		INSTRUCTIONS: Just place the files in the same folder that the html page.
			- AUDIO. I suggest using MP3, OGG. You can use WAV files too. 
			- VIDEO. MP4, OGG. You can use WEBM files too. 
		To add it to your HTML use this template:

		<div class = 'easymedia' id = 'type_name_width_height'>
		
		 - id explanation:
		 	type = can be "audio" or "video" (without quotes, according to your file)
		 	name = name of the files (all files must have the same name)
		 	width and height = the width and height of the video, it will NOT change anything in the audio.
