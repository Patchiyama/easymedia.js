easymedia
=========

One 'div' and your media is in.

		Originally created by Alejandro Perez Ordoyo AKA Patchiyama.

		Created to help people who love to have thin html or the one that doesnt like complications.
		INSTRUCTIONS: Just place the files in the same folder that the html page is.
			- AUDIO. I suggest using MP3, OGG. You can use WAV files too. It will use the best for the browser.
			- VIDEO. MP4, OGG. You can use WEBM files too. It will use the best as well.
		To add it to your HTML use this template:

		<div class = 'easymedia' id = 'type_name_width_height'>
		
		 - id explanation:
		 	type = can be "audio" or "video" (without quotes, according to your file)
		 	name = name of the files (all files must have the same name)
		 	width and height = the width and height of the video, it will NOT change anything in the audio.
